# What is this?

This is script I wrote that recursively looks for files of a certain extenstion
in a directory and moves them to the base level of the directory supplied. 

# Why?

It is usefull if you have a large dataset of files inside levels of directories
this can take them out and put them on level for further manipulation. 

# How to use

* Hava the scala compiler installed
* scala ReadFiles.scala <path> <file extention>
